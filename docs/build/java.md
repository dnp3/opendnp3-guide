The Java bindings are built as two separate pieces:

* standard JAR file
* native shared library built from the C++ source

!!! important Java 1.8 or greater is required because of features used in Java
    bindings

### Building the C++ bindings

Use the `-DDNP3_JAVA=ON` option when configuring CMake. CMake will locate your
JNI headers using the JAVA_HOME environment variable. The shared library must be
installed in a system location or the path specified using the
`system.library.path` JVM option.


### Building the JAR

The pure Java part of the bindings is built and installed locally using Maven:

```
> cd java
> mvn install
```

You can optionally suppress the integration tests during the build (e.g. if you
don't have library installed):

```
> mvn install -DskipTests
```

You can now use it in your Maven based Java projects using 

```xml
<dependencies>
...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.automatak.dnp3</groupId>
        <artifactId>opendnp3-bindings</artifactId>
        <version>${opendnp3.version}</version>
    </dependency>
...
</dependencies>
```
