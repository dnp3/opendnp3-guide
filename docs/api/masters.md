### Creating a master

A master in opendnp3 is a component that communicates with a single outstation via a communication channel. You may see this term used in other places to refer to a
collection of such components communicating with multiple outstations. When more than one master is bound to a single communication channel, it is called a
*multi-drop* configuration.  This refers to the way in which an RS-485 serial network is chained from device to device. Opendnp3 will let you add multiple
masters / outstations to any communication channel, regardless of the underlying transport. You could even bind a master to a TCP server and reverse the
normal connection direction.

To add a master to a communication channel you call the `AddMaster(...)` method on the channel interface:

```c++
// Contains static configuration for the master, and transport/link layers
MasterStackConfig stackConfig;

// you can optionally override these defaults like setting the application layer response timeout
// or change behaviors on the master
stackConfig.master.responseTimeout = TimeDuration::Seconds(2);
stackConfig.master.disableUnsolOnStartup = true;

// ... or you can override the default link layer settings
stackConfig.link.LocalAddr = 1;
stackConfig.link.RemoteAddr = 10;

auto master = channel->AddMaster(
  "master",                                       // alias for logging
  PrintingSOEHandler::Create(),                   // ISOEHandler (interface)
  DefaultMasterApplication::Create(),             // IMasterApplication (interface)
  stackConfig                                     // static stack configuration
);

// enable the master - you can also Disable() it or Shutdown() permanently
master->Enable();

```

### ISOEHandler

Note the 2nd parameter in the call to `AddMaster(...)`. This is the user-defined interface used to receive measurement data
that the master has received from the outstation. SOE stands for "Sequence of Events". SOE is a common term in SCADA circles
that is synonymous with "the order in which things occured".

```c++
class ISOEHandler
{
public:

	virtual void BeginFragment(const ResponseInfo& info) = 0;
    virtual void EndFragment(const ResponseInfo& info) = 0;

    virtual void Process(const HeaderInfo& info, const ICollection<Indexed<Binary>>& values) = 0;

	// more Process methods for types like Analog, Counter, etc ....
}
```

An ISOEHandler is just an interface with an overloaded `Process` method for every measurement type in DNP3
It also includes `BeginFragment` and `EndFragment` methods which can be used to tell when the processing
of a response starts and ends.

The `PrintingSOEHandler` in the snippet where we added the master is just a simple instance which prints values to the console.
You'll definitely want to write your own implementation so that you can write to file, database, or display on your application in some
fashion. The `PrintingSOEHandler` just extracts the measurement values from the ICollection like the following:

```
void Process(const HeaderInfo& info, const ICollection<Indexed<Binary>>& values)
{
	auto print = [](const Indexed<Binary>& pair) {
		std::cout << "[" << pair.index << "] : " << pair.value << std::endl;
	};
	values.ForeachItem(print);
}
```

There's also a wealth of information in the `HeaderInfo` object including:

* The specific group/variation associated with this ASDU header
* The QualifierCode associated with this header
* An enumeration describing the validity of the time-stamp for convenience to the programmer.
* The index of the header within the ASDU

!!! important
    Remember that the callbacks for the ISOEHandler methods come from the thread-pool. Depending on the
	number of sessions, you may not want to block the stack in these callbacks. You might consider allocating
	some kind of object that is passed to a worker thread to actually write the data to disk/database.


### IMasterApplication

The 3rd parameter in the call to `AddMaster(...)` is a user-defined interface called `IMasterApplication`. It
inherits from two sub-interfaces `ILinkListener` and `IUTCTimeSource` as well as adding a number of methods that are
master specific.

You can see all the methods you can override in the code documentation, but the most important ones are:

* `void IOnReceiveIIN(const IINField& iin)` - Notifies you whenever an ASDU is received containing an internal indication field
 (IIN field). This allow you to log and react to specific error bits returned by the device.

* `void OnTaskComplete(const TaskInfo& info)` - Tell you about tasks that are built into the master succeeding/failing. This callback
is usually used to assess the "health" of the session.

The `ILinkListener` interface is also used on IOutstationApplication and is described in its own [section](../api/linklayer.md#ilinklistener).

### MasterStackConfig

The final parameter passed into `AddMaster(...)` is a configuration struct that consists of link-layer configuration
information and static configuration that defines the masters behavior. The link-layer config is also used for outstations,
and is described in its own [section](../api/linklayer.md#configuration).

### MasterParams

Each of the dozen or so fields in this struct control certain automated behaviors within the master. Refer to the code documentation
for complete descriptions. This struct controls behaviors like:

* The default response timeout
* Whether to perform unsolicited disable/enable on start-up
* Whether to perform automatic time synchronization if requested
* The maximum Tx/Rx ASDU size which always default to 2K as per the DNP3 specification

### IMaster

When a master is added to a channel, the channel returns an `IMaster` interface. This interface provides all access to a number of operations
on the master. Refer to the code documentation for specifics. Some examples are:

* Add periodic scans to the master like exception (Class 1/2/3) and integrity scans (Class 1/2/3/0)
* Scanning for specific ranges or event counts
* The `ICommandProcessor` sub-interface allow you to do `SelectBeforeOperate` and `DirectOperate` requests w/ CROBs and Analog Outputs

### ICommandProcessor

This is a sub-interface that allows you to perform "select-before-operate" and "direct operate" commands.

```c++
class ICommandProcessor
{
public:
	virtual void SelectAndOperate(...params...) = 0;
	virtual void DirectOperate(...params...) = 0;
};
```

Opendnp3 supports multiple commands per request on both the master and the outstation, however, for convenience there are overloaded
methods to issue a single command of each type . You can use these overloads or build a `CommandSet`, which is a collection of headers.

```c++
CommandSet commands;
```

The easiest way to define headers is to use initializer_lists, but you can also create a specific header type
and then add entries in a loop.

```c++
// CROB to be sent to two indices
ControlRelayOutputBlock crob(ControlCode::LATCH_ON);

// Use initializer list to create a header in a single call - Send LATCH_ON to indices 0 and 1
commands.Add<ControlRelayOutputBlock>({ WithIndex(crob, 0), WithIndex(crob, 1) });

/// Add two analog outputs to the set using the header method.
/// Note that the 'header' is captured as a reference.
auto& header = commands.StartHeader<AnalogOutputInt16>();
header.Add(AnalogOutputInt16(7), 3);
header.Add(AnalogOutputInt16(9), 4);
```

You pass the command set into the master using one of the ICommandProcessor methods.

```c++
master->SelectAndOperate(std::move(commands), callback);
```

The callback is a lambda expression or `std::function` that accepts `ICommandTaskResult`
as its single argument.

```
auto callback = [](const ICommandTaskResult& result) -> void
{			
	std::cout << "Summary: " << TaskCompletionToString(result.summary) << std::endl;
	auto print = [](const CommandPointResult& res)
	{
		std::cout
			<< "Header: " << res.headerIndex
			<< " Index: " << res.index
			<< " State: " << CommandPointStateToString(res.state)
			<< " Status: " << CommandStatusToString(res.status);
	};
	result.ForeachItem(print);
};
```

The example above prints the summary value for the task, and information about the success or failure of each of the commands you specified in the CommandSet. Since we sent 4 individual command values, the handler would print something the following on a fully successful response:

```sh
Summary: SUCCESS
Header: 0 Index: 0 State: SUCCESS Status: SUCCESS
Header: 0 Index: 1 State: SUCCESS Status: SUCCESS
Header: 1 Index: 3 State: SUCCESS Status: SUCCESS
Header: 1 Index: 4 State: SUCCESS Status: SUCCESS
```

!!! imporant
    Even if the summary `TaskCompletion` value is SUCCESS, this doesn't mean that every command you sent was successful.
	It just means that the master got back some response that was parsed successfully. You must check the result for each
	command you sent individually. DNP3 allows for truncated responses if the outstation doesn't understand everything you
	sent. A possible response might be:

```sh
Summary: SUCCESS
Header: 0 Index: 0 State: SUCCESS Status: SUCCESS
Header: 0 Index: 1 State: SUCCESS Status: SUCCESS
Header: 1 Index: 3 State: SUCCESS Status: NOT_SUPPORTED
Header: 1 Index: 4 State: INIT Status: UNDEFINED
```

Note that you always get an entry for every command you specified, even if there's no response at all because the connection is down.

```sh
Summary: FAILURE_NO_COMMS
Header: 0 Index: 0 State: INIT Status: UNDEFINED
Header: 0 Index: 1 State: INIT Status: UNDEFINED
Header: 1 Index: 3 State: INIT Status: UNDEFINED
Header: 1 Index: 4 State: INIT Status: UNDEFINED
```

Refer to the Doxygen docs for detailed information about each enum type:

* `TaskCompletion` - The summary value for the task
* `CommandPointState` - The various result states for each command point.
* `CommandStatus` - The command status enumeration defined in the spec. Only valid for some states.

### Cleaning Up

Calls to `Shutdown()` are idempotent. The master will be permanently deleted once all references to the `shared_ptr<IMaster>` have been dropped.
